# Zero Knowledge Layer

The Zero Knowledge Layer of the Privacy Pool protocol encompasses the circom circuits responsible for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. These proofs enable users to interact with the protocol while preserving their privacy and the confidentiality of their transactions. The Zero Knowledge Layer plays a crucial role in maintaining the anonymity and unlinkability guarantees provided by the protocol.
