### Overview - Role in the Protocol

The Association Set Provider is a crucial compliance layer that controls which deposits can be privately withdrawn from Privacy Pools. It maintains a set of approved labels and provides the data necessary for cryptographic proofs of label inclusion, bridging privacy with regulatory requirements.

### Core Responsibilities

- Manages list of approved deposit labels
- Provides inclusion proofs for withdrawals
- Enables label revocation when needed
- Maintains compliance without compromising privacy

### Integration Points

- Interacts with Entrypoint via authorized postmen
- Provides roots for withdrawal validation
- Determines withdrawal eligibility
- Enforces protocol compliance rules

## Operation - Label Management

### Root Updates

- Only authorized postmen can update roots
- Each update includes:

  ```solidity
  struct AssociationSetData {
    uint256 root;        // Merkle root of approved labels
    bytes32 ipfsHash;    // Reference to off-chain data
    uint256 timestamp;   // Update timestamp
  }

  ```

- History maintained for proof verification
- Circular buffer stores recent roots

### Set Validation

- Withdrawals require valid ASP root
- Proof must demonstrate label inclusion
- Latest root used for validation
- Failed validations trigger ragequit option

### Wind Down Process

- Labels can be removed from ASP set
- Removal triggers withdrawal restrictions
- Original depositors can ragequit
- Ensures compliant exit path

The ASP system enables Privacy Pool to maintain compliance requirements while preserving the core privacy features of the protocol through cryptographic proofs and controlled label management.
